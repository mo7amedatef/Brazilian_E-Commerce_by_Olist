# Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Brazilian e-commerce market using the Olist dataset. The goal is to extract business insights and apply machine learning techniques to improve delivery performance, Cluster Customers, and assess Sales Prediction. The analysis follows a structured, professional approach incorporating advanced statistical methods and predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Olist's Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). It includes transaction data from various online marketplaces in Brazil, covering orders, payments, customers, sellers, product details, and reviews.

## Key Objectives
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth data exploration and visualization.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Generate meaningful features and integrate external data for better predictions.
3. **Delivery Performance Analysis:** Investigate delivery times and factors affecting delays.
4. **Clustering & Customer Sentiment:** Clustering the Customers into Groups based on their Features.
5. **Sales Prediction:** Build predictive models for estimating product sales.



## Methodology
- **EDA & Visualization:** Plotly-based graphs and statistical analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Clustering:** Customer segmentation using unsupervised learning (Completed).
- **Machine Learning:** Regression models for sales prediction and classification models for delivery performance and product quality.
- **Model Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization for improved accuracy.

## Requirements
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- KMeans, Ridge (for ML modeling)
